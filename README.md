# Machine-Learning
In this repository, you can find my work related to Machine Learning topics like Naive Bayesian classification on 20 Newsgroups dataset, KNeighbors classification on MNIST dataset etc.. 

KNN_MNIST.ipynb consists Exercise problems (1, 2) for Classification Topic (Chapter-3) in "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensor-Flow"
Note: Beginning of the code till exercises is just a practice along with the book and only difference is the usage of different digit image (4 in this case)
